# A Very Simple Weblog (Micro-Reddit)

> This is our first app using Rails and it consists of a very simple Weblog according to [these tutorial instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record-ruby-on-rails).

This project was built in order to learn about active records, models, and associations. We built an application similar to Reddit (called Micro-Reddit) where a user can create a post and add comments to it. We haven't implemented views yet so the project is a work in progress.

## Built With

- Ruby 3.0.0
- Rails 6.1.3.2 (Ruby Gem)
- Sqlite 1.4.2 (Ruby Gem)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

For this project, the following environment should be previously installed on your machine:

- Ruby 3.0.0
- Rails 6.1.3.2
- Node 14.17.0
- Yarn 1.22.10

### Setup

- Go to your terminal bash and, on any directory of your preference, run `git clone git@github.com:angelacuahutle/micro-reddit.git`
- Next, run `cd micro-reddit` to go into the project root directory
- Run `bundle install` to install all Ruby Gems this project requires

### Install

- Run `rails db:migrate` to migrate the databases needed to run this project
- Run `rails console` to perform your own tests with your newly created database and their validations, as well! You'll be able to **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**estroy any records from your tables: authors, posts, and comments. Here you have a simple summary with the most relevant features of each Table and their associations:

  #### Authors

      - password:string [6-16 chars, present]
      - id:integer
      - created_at:datetime
      - updated_at:datetime

      - *has_many posts*
      - *has_many comments*

  #### Posts

      - title:string [unique, present]
      - body:text [present]
      - author_id:integer [present]
      - id:integer
      - created_at:datetime
      - updated_at:datetime

      - *belongs_to author*
      - *has_many comments*

  #### Comments

      - body:text [present]
      - author_id:integer [present]
      - post_id:integer [present]
      - id:integer
